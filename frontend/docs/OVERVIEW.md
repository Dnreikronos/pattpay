## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The PattPay Dashboard is the main interface for managing transactions and on-chain payment links on Solana. The system allows users to monitor their transactions, create recurring payment links, and track real-time metrics.

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Identity

The dashboard embodies the **"Pixel Finance City"** aesthetic - a unique blend of:

- **Retro pixel art** (8-bit/16-bit inspired)
- **Modern minimalism** (clean, functional)
- **Isometric perspective** (depth and dimension)
- **Brand colors** (lavender background, indigo primary, golden accents)

Every component should feel like part of a cohesive, living DeFi ecosystem.
